## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will be a skin care blog webpage with articles on skin care organized by skin condition and recommended skin care products.  Users can sign up for an account where they can like or save articles and products under their account to create their own library and reference later.  Users can also share articles and favored products with non-users.  

This idea came about because my background is in public health with a focus on skin cancer research and prevention.  Patients commonly ask for recommendations on skin care products, it would be useful to refer them to a single website with consolidated recommendations.
